- A local web server (for testing)

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the project directory in your code editor
3. In `app.js`, replace `'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'` with your actual OpenAI API key

## Running the Application

### Option 1: Using a Local Web Server (Recommended)

1. Install a simple HTTP server if you don't have one:
   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   http-server -p 8000
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`

### Option 2: Direct File Access
You can also open the `index.html` file directly in your browser, but note that some features might be limited due to browser security restrictions.
